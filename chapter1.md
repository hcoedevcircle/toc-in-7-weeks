Sets, Relation and Languages

## Sets

Set is a collection of objects.  For example: `L = {a,b,c,d}` is a set.

Objects that make any set are its **elements** or **members** . In the above example, `a` is a member of set `L`. Similarly `c`  is also a member of set `L`. We denote these as `a ∈ L` *(read as: a 'belongs to' L)*. But since `z` is not a member or element of set `L` . We write `z` as `z ∉ L` *(read as: z 'does not belong to' L)*.

In sets, The repetition are not taken care. So set, `{orange, apple}` is same as `{orange, apple, apple}`.

Also, the order is also not taken care of. So set, `{pizza, burger}` is same as `{burger, pizza}`.

A set does not necessarily have to be a relation among their members. So, `{pizza, truck, apple, computer, star}` is also an set.

Likewise, a set can contain a set as element. For example `{apple, {toy, brick}, berry}` is a valid set.

A set that has only onle element is called singleton set. For example. `{1}`, `{apple}`  are singleton set.
