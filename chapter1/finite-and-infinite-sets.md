## Finite and Infinite Sets

We discuss about our intution of finite and infinite set in this topic. A question.

> What is a finite set?

We generally percieve that a finite set is a set that has finite <em>size</em>. Yes, ***size*** is the baisc property of set when we categorize it as finite or infinite. And the our definition is so obvious and natural that it hardly needs proof. 


However, there are situations where our notion of *size* leads to difficultiies. Put forward an example:

Do you consider size of set of prime numbers more than that of perfect squares? Definately we cannot get to any satisfactory conclusion, but experience in the field has shown that the only satisfactory explaination is to regard these two sets having the same size. 


### Equinumerous Set

Two sets A and B are called **equinumerous** if there is a bijection `f: A -> B`. 

With the concept of Equinumerous set, we can define a set as **finite**  set if, it is equinumerous with `{1,2,....,n}` for some natural number `n`. 

A set is **infinite** if it is not finite. For an obvious example, the set of natural numbers are infinite. However infinite set also can be equinumerous. (As in our first example of prime numbers and perfect squares)

A set is said to be **countably infinite** if it is equinumerous with N, and **countable** if it is finite, or countably infinite.  A set that is not countable is called **uncountable**
